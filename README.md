# Kmeans-Clustering-Visualization

This Python project brings the K-Means Clustering algorithm to life. It lets users input their own data points and choose how many clusters they want. The program then uses K-Means to group the data and shows the results with a matplotlib graph. By playing around with this tool, people can see how data points end up in clusters based on how close they are to centroids.

##  Features

- Interactive input of data points via command line
- Dynamic selection of cluster count
- Real-time graphical representation of clustering
